# Global Parameters
This document provides a description of all required global parameters in the simulator configuration

## General Parameters

    <td> Parameter Name </td>
    <td> Description </td>
    <td> Expected Datatype </td>
    <td> Valid Range </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> speed_of_sound </td>
    <td> The speed of sound, in meters per second, used for this configuration </td>
    <td> float </td>
    <td> a positive, non-zero number. Typical value for underwater speed of sound is ~1500 m/s </td>

## Position Parameters

  <tr>
    <td> Parameter Name </td>
    <td> Description </td>
    <td> Expected Datatype </td>
    <td> Valid Range </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td> hydrophone_positions </td>
    <td> A list containing the positions (in meters) of all hydrophones in the configuration </td>
    <td> a list with elements of type sim_utils.common_types.PolarPosition or sim_utils.common_types.CartesianPosition. Must be the same type across all elements </td>
    <td> The zeroth element of the list must be the origin (<code>PolarPosition(0,0,0)</code> or <code>CartesianPosition(0,0,0)</code>). The rest must be at a eucledian distance from the origin of no more than speed_of_sound/signal_frequency. The list must have at least 4 elements </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> pinger_position </td>
    <td> The position (in meters) of the pinger in the configuration </td>
    <td> sim_utils.common_types.PolarPosition or sim_utils.common_types.CartesianPosition </td>
    <td> Could theoretically be any valid position, but it is recommended that the pinger should be at a euclidean distance of no more than 50m from the origin </td>

## Frequency Parameters

    <td> Description </td>
    <td> Expected Datatype </td>
    <td> Valid Range </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td> signal_frequency </td>
    <td> The frequency, in Hz, of the sound wave generated by the pinger </td>
    <td> float </td>
    <td> Recommended to be 25, 30, 35, or 40 kHz (corresponding to competition pinger values) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> sampling_frequency </td>
    <td> The frequency, in Hz, at which the digital part of the system samples the signal </td>
    <td> float </td>
    <td> Must be at least 2*signal_frequency. Recommended to be at least 5*signal_frequency </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> continuous_sampling_frequency </td>
    <td> The frequency, in Hz, at which the signal in the analog portion of the system is sampled. Ideally, this would be infinite for a continuous signal but that is impossible </td>
    <td> float </td>
    <td> Must be much higher than the value of sampling_frequency. Recommended value is at least 10*sampling_frequency </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> carrier_frequency </td>
    <td> The frequency of the square wave envelope of the pinger signal (i.e. the frequency at which the sound emitted turns on/off) </td>
    <td> float </td>
    <td> Recommended to be 0.5, 1, or 2 to correspond to Benthos ALP-365 used in competition </td>
